## Medium
Given a rod of length n inches and an array price[], where price[i] denotes the value of a piece of length i (1-based Index). Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.
Note: The value of n is equal to the size of price array.
Example:
Input: price[] = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]Output: 22Explanation: The maximum obtainable value is 22 by cutting in two pieces of lengths 2 and&nbsp;6, i.e., 5 + 17 = 22.
Input: price[] = [3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]Output: 24Explanation:&nbsp;The maximum obtainable value is&nbsp;24 by cutting the rod into 8 pieces&nbsp;of length 1, i.e, 8*price[1] = 8*3 = 24.
Input: price[] = [3]Output: 3Explanation: There is only 1 way to pick a piece of length 1.
