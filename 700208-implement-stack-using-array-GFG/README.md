# [Implement Stack using Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implement-stack-using-array/1)
## Easy
Implement a Stack using an Array, where the size of the array, n&nbsp;is given. The Stack must support the following operations:
(i) push(x): Insert an element x at the top of the stack.(ii) pop(): Remove the element from the top of the stack.(iii) peek(): Return the top element if not empty, else -1.(iv) isEmpty(): Return true if the stack is empty else return false.(v) isFull(): Return true if the stack is full else return false.
There will be a sequence of queries queries[][].&nbsp;The queries are represented in numeric form:
 

1 x : Call push(x)
2 : Call pop() 
3 : Call peek()
4&nbsp; : Call isEmpty()
5 : Call isFull()

You just have to implement the functions push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and isFull.&nbsp;The driver code will handle the output.
Note: All the queries are valid.
Examples:
Input: n = 3, q = 6, queries[][] = [[1, 5], [1, 3], [3], [2], [4], [5]]
Output: [3, false, false]
Explanation: Queries on stack are as follows:push(5) : Insert 5 at the top of the stack.push(3) : Insert 3 at the top of the stack.peek() : Return the top element i.e. 3.pop() : Remove the top element i.e. 3.isEmpty() : return false as the stack is not empty.isFull() : return false as the stack is not full. Capacity = 3.
Input: n = 1, q = 5, queries[][] =  [[2], [3], [4], [1, 9], [5]]
Output: [-1, -1, true, true]
Explanation: Queries on stack are as follows:pop(): Since stack is empty, nothing is popped.peek(): Return the top element. Since the stack is empty, return -1.isEmpty(): Return true as the stack is empty.push(9): Insert 9 at the top of the stack. The stack will be [9].isFull(): Return true as the stack is full. Capacity = 1.
Constraints:1&nbsp;≤ n ≤ 1031 ≤ q ≤ 1030 ≤ x&nbsp;≤ 105
