## Medium
Given an array arr[]. Rotate the array to the left (counter-clockwise direction) by d steps, where d is a positive integer.&nbsp;Do the mentioned change in the&nbsp;array in place.
Note: Consider the array as circular.
Examples :
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], d = 2
Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
Explanation: when rotated by 2 elements, it becomes [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].
Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20], d = 3
Output: [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 2, 4, 6]
Explanation: when rotated by 3 elements, it becomes [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 2, 4, 6].
Input: arr[] = [7, 3, 9, 1], d = 9
Output: [3, 9, 1, 7]
Explanation: when we rotate 9 times, we'll get [3, 9, 1, 7] as resultant array.
